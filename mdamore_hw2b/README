So this time there wont be a make file, simply run javac on the server.java file, then java server, and the JVM and Java compiler will do most of the heavy lifting. Also, attached youll find a sample run on ipv4 and ipv6, and a server log for a run of the program.

Example run

Javac Server.java

Java Server <Log File> <Optional Port Number>
